# Tactical-Fortune-Bow

## Description
It has an RC car base that allows it to move around and give people their fortune. It uses flywheels to launch a small disc with a fortune inside whenever it encounters people. It has two beefy servos that allow it to turn left, right, up, and down. There is one tiny motor that powers the launching system to push the fortune discs into the flywheels. Above the discs is a tube that allows for multiple to be stored, carried, and launched all at once.

## Why?

After brainstorming for a solid -2 seconds, we decided to make the Fortune shooter because it was a really fun idea and it is probably the best project to ever exist within the confines of GitHub HQ.
