# Tactical-Fortune-Bow
This is where we will be commiting all files related to our Undercity Project: Tactical Fortune Bow!

## Description
This "bow" was the result of multiple all-nighters, sppilled drinks, and various crashouts. It is a device that shoots out discs that contain a hidden fortune inside, similar to a fortune cookie, just in a slightly more aggressive way. Our shooting module can move in all 4 directions, and is also mounted on top of an RC car, which we modded to fit our constraints.
